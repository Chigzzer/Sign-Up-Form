# Description  
A simple project to help me understand how forms work and how to style them. Especially as Forms are one of the key methods of the user interacting with the website. The website can use basic validation via html and some basic validation done via Javascript, such as making sure the password's match.

* View on mobile and other devices.
* Style of the different themes
* Tidy up of the code in terms of comments and css 


# What I have Learnt
* How to make the font size change with the screen size and the other multiple functions in CSS.
* How to create forms and use appearance none to style the form to your specific liking.
* Use of variables in CSS and how to edit them via JavaScript (E.G: Dark/Light theme).
* Use of validation in the form, such as making sure the passwords match each other and pass al requirements.



# To Do
